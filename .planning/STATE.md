# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Reliable inventory tracking -- every material movement must be atomic, accurate, and audited
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — transaction-safety

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Phase 01 P02 | 7min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Split research's 6-phase structure into 8 phases for fine granularity -- separated transaction safety from data layer cleanup, separated code quality from performance
- [Roadmap]: Transaction safety is Phase 1 because every other phase depends on correct data -- testing, caching, and monitoring are meaningless on inconsistent data
- [Phase 01]: checkLowStockAlert returns data instead of publishing -- post-commit event pattern for inventory safety
- [Phase 01]: createAuditLog accepts optional TxClient param for transaction-aware audit logging
- [Phase 01]: getDelegateTx uses tx[modelName] for transaction-bound Prisma model access (not global prisma)
- [Phase 01]: MI approve keeps two separate transactions (processApproval + stock reservation) per research -- approval is idempotent, stock is recoverable
- [Phase 01]: Three-phase approval pattern established: READ outside tx, MUTATE in $transaction, NOTIFY post-commit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: httpOnly cookie migration (SECR-05 area) touches auth middleware, frontend API client, service worker, and requires CSRF protection -- needs careful design in Phase 3 planning
- [Research]: Prisma migration re-baseline (INFR-03) needs testing against both fresh and existing databases
- [Research]: Parallel approval concurrency (VERF-02) is completely untested -- may surface race conditions during Phase 7
